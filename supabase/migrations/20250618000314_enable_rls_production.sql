  # Re-enable RLS with Production Security Policies
  
  This migration re-enables Row Level Security on the transcriptions table
  with proper policies for production use. It ensures:
  
  1. Public can insert transcripts for active agents (for widget functionality)
  2. Authenticated users can only view transcripts for their own agents
  3. Proper security boundaries are maintained
